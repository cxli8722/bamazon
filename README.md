Welcome to Bamazon 
The bamazon node portal allows users to purchase items from different departments. The user will first see the list of items on a table. 


Then the user will be prompted to enter the item id and how many items they want to purchase. 



If the item is in stock, the screen will display the product, quantity, and total cost. 



 If the item is not in stock, the screen will display “sorry out of stock”.  The product table is updated automatically when product is purchased by customer.
